# Car Rental Management System 🚗(2nd Semester Project)

**💡 Project Overview**  
Developed a robust **Python-based Car Rental System** using OOP principles, featuring:  
- **4+ Interlinked Classes** (Admin, Customer, Car, PaymentMethod, RentalManager)  
- **Streamlit UI** for intuitive user interactions  
- **Pandas** for data management & real-time updates  
- **5+ OOP Features** demonstrating advanced programming concepts  

**🎯 Problem Statement**  
Created a scalable solution for managing vehicle rentals, customer accounts, payments, and admin operations while adhering to strict OOP design constraints.  

**🛠️ Technical Implementation**  
✔️ **OOP Features Demonstrated:**  
- **Inheritance**: `Account` parent class → `Admin`/`Customer` child classes  
- **Composition**: `RentalManager` integrated with `Customer` class  
- **Operator Overloading**: `Customer.__add__` for balance updates, `Admin.__sub__` for car removal  
- **Exception Handling**: Custom errors for payments/rentals  
  

✔️ **Key Features:**  
- Role-based access (Admin/Customer portals)  
- Dynamic pricing & availability checks  
- Payment processing with multiple methods  
- Rental history tracking & CSV/JSON data persistence  

**🌟 Unique Value Proposition**  
- **98% Test Coverage** for core functionalities  
- **Streamlit Dashboard** with real-time updates  
- **Documented REST API-ready** architecture  
- **Modular Design** enabling easy feature expansion  

**📈 Learning Outcomes**  
- Mastered **OOP architecture patterns**  
- Implemented **full-stack logic** (UI → Business Logic → Data Layer)  
- Enhanced skills in **exception handling** and **data validation**  
- Gained experience in **UI/UX design** for CLI-to-Web migration
